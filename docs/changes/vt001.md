::: warning Future Deprecation
The deprecation is planned in the future, where you could start migrating your plugin to use the new API if you move fast. To identify your usage, set `future.deprecationWarnings.pluginHookSsrArgument` to `true` in your vite config.

Before Vite 6, only two environments were available: `client` and `ssr`. A single `options.ssr` plugin hook argument in `resolveId`, `load` and `transform` allowed plugin authors to differentiate between these two environments when processing modules in plugin hooks. In Vite 6, a Vite application can define any number of named environments as needed. We're introducing `this.environment` in the plugin context to interact with the environment of the current module in hooks.

| Stages           | Version                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| First Introduced | `v6.0.0`                                 |
| Deprecation      | (planned in `v7.0.0`)                    |
| Feature Removal  | (currently no plan to remove completely) |

## Motivation

`this.environment` not only allow the plugin hook implementation to know the current environment name, it also gives access to the environment config options, module graph information, and transform pipeline (`environment.options`, `environment.moduleGraph`, `environment.transformRequest()`). Having the environment instance available in the context allows plugin authors to avoid the dependency of the whole dev server (typically cached at startup through the `configureServer` hook).

## Migration Guide

For the existing plugin to do a quick migration, replace the `options.ssr` argument with `this.environment.name !== 'client'` in the `resolveId`, `load` and `transform` hooks:

```ts
import { Plugin } from 'vite'

export function myPlugin(): Plugin {
  return {
    name: 'my-plugin',
    resolveId(id, importer, options) {
      const isSSR = options.ssr // [!CODE --]
      const isSSR = this.environment.name !== 'client' // [!CODE ++]

      if (isSSR) {
        // SSR specific logic
      } else {
        // Client specific logic
      }
    },
  }
}
```

For a more robust long term implementation, the plugin hook should handle for [multiple environments](/guide/api-vite-environment.html#accessing-the-current-environment-in-hooks) using fine-grained environment options instead of relying on the environment name.
