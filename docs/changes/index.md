# Major Changes

This is a list of major changes in Vite and planned future deprecations/removals.

## Current

We're reaching out to framework, plugin authors, and users to apply these changes. Deprecation or usage warnings will guide you where possible.

## Future

These are experimental APIs that intend to improve upon current usage patterns. There are more experimental APIs that the ones listed here. For a complete list of experimental features, please checkout the [Experimental Label in Vite GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/discussions/categories/feedback?discussions_q=label%3Aexperimental+category%3AFeedback).

We don't recommend switching to these APIs yet. They are included in Vite to help us gather feedback. Please check these proposals and let us know how they work in your use case using the linked Discussions in each.
